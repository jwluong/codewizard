# Code Wizard

A Rails app I made in 9 days designed to gamify flash cards.

## Motivation
After experiencing how boring and dull simple multiple-choice quizzes and flash cards are, Code Wizard was created as an attempt to make learning the basics of Ruby more interesting and engaging.

## Features
- Fully animated

- Fully functional combat system

- Fully functional item and inventory system

- Working Leaderboard and points system

## Getting started
**Live version:** [https://codewizard.world](https://codewizard.world)
